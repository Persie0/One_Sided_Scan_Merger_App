# Info
With this application (only .exe as release, but you can make one yourself for other platforms) you can merge pdfs from a one sided scanner on Windows, Linux, Mac written in Python with Tkinter.
You can merge the two PDF files: one containing all odd pages of a scan, one containing all even pages of a scan in reverse order.

It has a simple UI where you can choose the 2 pdfs you want to merge.
So all frontpages + all backpages in reverse order -> merged PDF
