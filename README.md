With this application (.exe) you can merge pdfs from a one sided scanner.
merge two PDF files: one containing all odd pages of a scan, one containing all even pages of a scan in reverse order.

It has a simple UI where you can choose the 2 pdfs you want to merge.
So all frontpages + all backpages in reverse order -> merged PDF
